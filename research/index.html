	<h1>Research</h1>
		<p> My primary work has been in developing the first succesful neural prosthetic for speech for someone who cannot speak. For this work, I trained large ensembles of neural networks and interfaced their predictions with language models. Below is the decoding pipeline from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-0608-8">previous work</a> by colleagues in my lab (led by Joe Makin), which decoded sentences from neural recordings of epilepsy patients.</p>

		<p> I also worked with researchers at UC Berkeley to finalize a manuscript that came from my final project in Deep Unsupervised Learning, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07724.pdf">evaluating self supervised learning without using labels</a>. Using our methods, one can automatically select augmentations for constrastive learning without using labels that outperform hand selected augmentations picked using labels as feedback. The automatic augmentation selection process is also extremely efficient, and takes the same amount of compute as just four runs of self-supervised learning. Hand selecting augmentations usually requires 100s of runs. Below is an image summarizing our approach. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07724.pdf">Arxiv</a> </p>

		<p> I have also been researching neural population dynamics during speech, using deep learning methods for dimensionality reduction and analysis. An exmaple of this applied to perception can be seen in Emily Stephen, Yuanning Li, Sean Metzger, Yulia Oganian, & Edward Chang (2021) “Multivariate temporal receptive fields in speech perception reflect low-dimensional dynamics”. COSYNE. 
	<h2>Consulting</h2>
		<p> I completed a freelance consulting project with <a href="https://generatecapital.com/">Generate Capital</a> to create automatic data aggregation of solar array performance data. I then integrated the performance data with customer billing histories and produced scripts for data analysis in Python.
