	<h1>Research</h1>
		<p> My primary work has been in developing a neural prosthetic for speech. For this work, I trained ensembles of neural networks to predict words given a participants neural population activity. While I cannot reveal as many details as I would like before our paper is published, we have acheived state of the art results for communication neuroprostheses.<\p>
			
		<p> I was also fortunate to do research with Colorado Reed, Aravind Srinivas, Trevor Darrell, and Kurt Keutzer as a followup to a final project on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07724.pdf">evaluating self supervised learning without using labels</a>. Using our methods, one can automatically select augmentations for constrastive learning without using labels that outperform hand selected augmentations picked using labels as feedback. Arxiv preprint: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07724.pdf<\p>

	<h2>Consulting</h2>
		<p> I did a small consulting project with <a href="https://generatecapital.com/">Generate Capital</a> to create automatic data aggregation and analyses pipleines in Python.
