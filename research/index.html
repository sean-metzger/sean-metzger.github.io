	<h1>Research</h1>
		<p> My primary work has been in developing a neural prosthetic for speech. For this work, I trained ensembles of neural networks to predict words given a participants neural population activity. While I cannot reveal as many details as I would like before our paper is published, we have acheived state of the art results for communication neuroprostheses.</p>
			
		<p> I was also fortunate to do research with Colorado Reed, Aravind Srinivas, Trevor Darrell, and Kurt Keutzer as a followup to a final project on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07724.pdf">evaluating self supervised learning without using labels</a>. Using our methods, one can automatically select augmentations for constrastive learning without using labels that outperform hand selected augmentations picked using labels as feedback. The automatic augmentation selection process is also extremely efficient, and takes the same amount of compute as just four runs of MoCov2! <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07724.pdf">Arxiv</a> </p>
		
		<p> I have also been researching neural population dynamics during speech, using deep learning methods for dimensionality reduction and analysis. 
	<h2>Consulting</h2>
		<p> I did a small consulting project with <a href="https://generatecapital.com/">Generate Capital</a> to create automatic data aggregation of solar array performance data, integration it with customer billing records, and data analysis in Python.
