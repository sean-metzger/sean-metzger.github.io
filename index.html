		<p> About me: </p>
		<p>I'm a first year Ph.D. student in the UC Berkeley/UCSF graduate program in bioengineering advised by <a href="http://changlab.ucsf.edu/">Edward Chang</a> .</p>
		<p>I am interested in modeling and understanding large neural population dynamics during speech, building a brain computer interface to restore speech, neural engineering, and deep learning. Before starting my Ph.D. I received a B.S.
			and M.S. in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where I did research with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~palanker/lab/">Daniel Palanker</a> on retinal prostheses and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/william-dally">Bill Dally</a> on high efficiency power conversion.</p>
