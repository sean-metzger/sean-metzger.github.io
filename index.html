	<h1>Sean Metzger</h1>
		<p>I am a second year Ph.D. student in the UC Berkeley/UCSF graduate program in bioengineering advised by <a href="http://changlab.ucsf.edu/">Edward Chang</a>.</p>. 
		<p>I am interested in modeling and understanding complex systems (eg neural activity during speech) using cutting edge machine learning techniques, as well as deep unsupervised learning, and deep learning in general. I am also extremely interested in sustainability. Before starting my Ph.D. I obtained a B.S.
			and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, where I did research with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~palanker/lab/">Daniel Palanker</a> on photovoltaic retinal prosthetics and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/william-dally">Bill Dally</a> on high efficiency power converters for solar cells.</p> 
		<p> I was also an TomKat center for Sustainable Energy summer fellow at <a href="https://www.healyxlabs.com/">Healyx Labs</a>, where I helped develop a solar charging system for negative pressure wound therapy.
